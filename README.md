## About EQEquation-Website👇

>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) has given Deepa a weapon to reach new heights of success. Leaders need tools along with their high IQ, luck, and that’s what EQ Equation empowers them. Since she began her professional journey, she has never said NO to an opportunity that led me to take up a sales job while working as a scientist. She has lived/worked in four continents and understood the secret ingredient “your unique style”. Educational institutions engrave us with the belief to keep working hard all our life to be successful. No education gives us the soft skills and how to use one’s natural technique to be an empathetic impactful leader.

>EqEquation was established to help people enjoy a fulfilled life using emotional intelligence techniques like self-awareness and empathy to achieve your goals in professional and personal life. My name is Deepa Sethi. I started my career as a scientist and then transitioned to be a successful strategic salesperson. I have lived in 4 continents and done business across the globe. Understanding the power of emotional intelligence has helped me excel in all positions and relationships, especially when the stakes are high. Navigating with empathy has helped me maintain or build new relationships with whoever I meet. It may be with cab drivers, someone on the flight, at home, or when developing a strategic partnership with large multinationals. Most leaders spend 60% of their time using their EI in their day to day activities. So why delaying building EI in our future leaders and only focusing on intelligence that is taught in our existing education system. We at EQ Equation help you find your authentic style to succeed. Regardless of what level of an organization you may be or individual that is looking to improve communication in personal life or help young adults to connect with themselves in a deeper manner.  EQ Equation works individually in balancing emotions which leads to make this world a better place to live in. We look forward to connecting with you.
